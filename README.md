# Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator in Javascript

This project consists of three different functionalities implemented in JavaScript: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator.

Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator functionality allows the user to input the marks obtained by a student and generates a grade for the student based on the marks obtained.

Speed Detector
The Speed Detector functionality allows the user to input the speed of a vehicle and checks whether the vehicle is overspeeding or not based on the speed limit. If the speed is less than the speed limit, the application displays "OK". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit, the application gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.When the total number of demerit points exceeds 12,the application displays "License Suspended"

Net Salary Calculator
The Net Salary Calculator functionality allows the user to input the basic salary and benefits of an employee and calculates the net salary after deducting the applicable taxes.
